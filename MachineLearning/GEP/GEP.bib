abstract = {In this paper, a novel self-learning gene expression programming (GEP) methodology named SL-GEP is proposed to improve the search accuracy and efficiency of GEP. In contrast to the existing GEP variants, the proposed SL-GEP features a novel chromosome representation in which each chromosome is embedded with subfunctions that can be deployed to construct the final solution. As part of the chromosome, the subfunctions are self-learned or self-evolved by the proposed algorithm during the evolutionary search. By encompassing subfunctions or any partial solution as input arguments of another subfunction, the proposed SL-GEP facilitates the formation of sophisticated, higher-order, and constructive subfunctions that improve the accuracy and efficiency of the search. Further, a novel search mechanism based on differential evolution is proposed for the evolution of chromosomes in the SL-GEP. The proposed SL-GEP is simple, generic and has much fewer control parameters than the traditional GEP variants. The proposed SL-GEP is validated on 15 symbolic regression problems and six even-parity problems. Experimental results show that the proposed SL-GEP offers enhanced performances over several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and search efficiency.},

abstract = {Wind surface mean pressure coefficient (C̄p) is an essential parameter for the assessment of wind induced forces that is a must input to all structural designs. An extensive experimentation is carried out to obtain pressure coefficient data over the surfaces of C-shaped building models of varying aspect ratio, corner curvature and angle of incidence in a sub-sonic wind tunnel. The studies also include models without corner curvature. In this study, a technique known as Gene-Expression Programming (GEP) is used to develop a model equation using experimental values of pressure coefficient data collected at the grid points of the frontal surface under varying conditions. And this developed model is used to predict surface mean pressure coefficients (Cp). The predicted values of C̄p using the developed model are compared with the corresponding C̄p values obtained by Swami and Chandra (S&C) equation and Muehleisen and Patrizi (M&P) equations. The prediction made by the developed GEP model is also validated with the actual building data of Tokyo Polytechnic University (TPU). The results signify the ability of the model to predict the C̄p values for practical purposes. The error analysis of the results show that the predicted values of C̄p using developed GEP correlation are more close to the experimental values than those obtained by using other two methods.},

abstract = {Existing Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes-based transition models do not accurately predict separation induced transition for low pressure turbines. Therefore, in this paper, a novel framework based on computational fluids dynamics (CFD) driven machine learning coupled with multi-expression and multi-objective optimization is explored to develop models which can improve the transition prediction for the T106A low pressure turbine at an isentropic exit Reynolds number of Re2is = 100, 000. Model formulations are proposed for the transfer and laminar eddy viscosity terms of the laminar kinetic energy transition model using seven non-dimensional pi groups. The multi-objective optimization approach makes use of cost functions based on the suction-side wall-shear stress and the pressure coefficient. A family of solutions is thus developed, whose performance is assessed using Pareto analysis and in terms of physical characteristics of separated-flow transition. Two models are found which bring the wall-shear stress profile in the separated region at least two times closer to the reference high-fidelity data than the baseline transition model. As these models are able to accurately predict the flow coming off the blade trailing edge, they are also able to significantly enhance the wake-mixing prediction over the baseline model. This is the first known study which makes use of ‘CFD-driven' machine learning to enhance the transition prediction for a non-canonical flow.},

abstract = {Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm that has been widely used for solving many real-world optimization problems. However, traditional GP can only solve a single task in one independent run, which is inefficient in cases where multiple tasks need to be solved at the same time. Recently, multifactorial optimization (MFO) has been proposed as a new evolutionary paradigm toward evolutionary multitasking. It intends to conduct evolutionary search on multiple tasks in one independent run. To enable multitasking GP, in this paper, we propose a novel multifactorial GP (MFGP) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to conduct multitasking GP using a single population. The proposed MFGP consists of a novel scalable chromosome encoding scheme which is capable of representing multiple solutions simultaneously, and new evolutionary mechanisms for MFO based on self-learning gene expression programming. Further, comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on multitask scenarios consisting of commonly used GP benchmark problems and real world applications. The obtained empirical results confirmed the efficacy of the proposed MFGP.},

abstract = {This paper introduces two novel concepts in data-driven turbulence modeling that enable the simultaneous development of multiple closure models and the training towards multiple objectives. The concepts extend the evolutionary framework by Weatheritt and Sandberg (2016) [1], which derives interpretable and implementation-ready expressions from high-fidelity simulation data. By assigning a shared fitness value to the evolved closure models and utilizing the CFD-driven training approach by Zhao et al. (2020) [2], the multi-expression training concept introduced here is able to account for the coupling between the trained models, i.e. Reynolds stress anisotropy, turbulent heat flux and turbulence production correction models. As a second concept, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is applied to the framework. The extension yields a diverse set of candidate models and allows a trade-off between the training objectives after analyzing the training results. In this study, the novel concepts are applied to a benchmark periodic hills case and a vertical natural convection flow. The predictions of mean flow quantities are improved compared to decoupled training strategies with distinct and robust improvements for strongly coupled momentum and thermal fields. The coupled training of closure models and the balancing of multiple training objectives are considered important capabilities on the path towards generalized data-driven turbulence models.},

abstract = {Nonlinear turbulence closures were developed that improve the prediction accuracy of wake mixing in low-pressure turbine (LPT) flows. First, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculations using five linear turbulence closures were performed for the T106A LPT profile at isentropic exit Reynolds numbers 60,000 and 100,000. None of these RANS models were able to accurately reproduce wake loss profiles, a crucial parameter in LPT design, from direct numerical simulation (DNS) reference data. However, the recently proposed kv2{\"{I}} ‰ transition model was found to produce the best agreement with DNS data in terms of blade loading and boundary layer behavior and thus was selected as baseline model for turbulence closure development. Analysis of the DNS data revealed that the linear stress-strain coupling constitutes one of the main model form errors. Hence, a gene-expression programming (GEP) based machine-learning technique was applied to the high-fidelity DNS data to train nonlinear explicit algebraic Reynolds stress models (EARSM), using different training regions. The trained models were first assessed in an a priori sense (without running any RANS calculations) and showed much improved alignment of the trained models in the region of training. Additional RANS calculations were then performed using the trained models. Importantly, to assess their robustness, the trained models were tested both on the cases they were trained for and on testing, i.e., previously not seen, cases with different flow features. The developed models improved prediction of the Reynolds stress, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production, wake-loss profiles, and wake maturity, across all cases.},

abstract = {Machine learning was applied to large-eddy simulation (LES) data to develop nonlinear turbulence stress and heat flux closures with increased prediction accuracy for trailingedge cooling slot cases. The LES data were generated for a thick and a thin trailing-edge slot and shown to agree well with experimental data, thus providing suitable training data for model development. A gene expression programming (GEP) based algorithm was used to symbolically regress novel nonlinear explicit algebraic stress models and heat-flux closures based on either the gradient diffusion or the generalized gradient diffusion approaches. Steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculations were then conducted with the new explicit algebraic stress models. The best overall agreement with LES data was found when selecting the near wall region, where high levels of anisotropy exist, as training region, and using the mean squared error of the anisotropy tensor as cost function. For the thin lip geometry, the adiabatic wall effectiveness was predicted in good agreement with the LES and experimental data when combining the GEP-trained model with the standard eddy-diffusivity model. Crucially, the same model combination also produced significant improvement in the predictive accuracy of adiabatic wall effectiveness for different blowing ratios (BRs), despite not having seen those in the training process. For the thick lip case, the match with reference values deteriorated due to the presence of large-scale, relative to slot height, vortex shedding. A GEPtrained scalar flux model, in conjunction with a trained RANS model, was found to significantly improve the prediction of the adiabatic wall effectiveness.},

The aim is to investigate the capabilities of a multiple output GEP (moGEP) technique and compare its performance to that of a single-gene GEP chromosome (ugGEP).

abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

abstract = {Advances in machine learning (ML) coupled with increased computational power have enabled identification of patterns in data extracted from complex systems. ML algorithms are actively being sought in recovering physical models or mathematical equations from data. This is a highly valuable technique where models cannot be built using physical reasoning alone. In this paper, we investigate the application of fast function extraction (FFX), a fast, scalable, deterministic symbolic regression algorithm to recover partial differential equations (PDEs). FFX identifies active bases among a huge set of candidate basis functions and their corresponding coefficients from recorded snapshot data. This approach uses a sparsity-promoting technique from compressive sensing and sparse optimization called pathwise regularized learning to perform feature selection and parameter estimation. Furthermore, it recovers several models of varying complexity (number of basis terms). FFX finally filters out many identified models using non-dominated sorting and forms a Pareto front consisting of optimal models with respect to minimizing complexity and test accuracy. Numerical experiments are carried out to recover several ubiquitous PDEs such as wave and heat equations among linear PDEs and Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), and Kawahara equations among higher-order nonlinear PDEs. Additional simulations are conducted on the same PDEs under noisy conditions to test the robustness of the proposed approach. c 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {This paper presents an assessment of machine-learned turbulence closures, trained for improving wake-mixing prediction, in the context of LPT flows. To this end, a three-dimensional cascade of industrial relevance, representative of modern LPT bladings, was analyzed, using a state-of-the-art RANS approach, over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. To ensure that the wake originates from correctly reproduced blade boundary-layers, preliminary analyses were carried out to check for the impact of transition closures, and the best-performing numerical setup was identified. Two different machine-learned closures were considered. They were applied in a prescribed region downstream of the blade trailing edge, excluding the endwall boundary layers. A sensitivity analysis to the distance from the trailing edge at which they are activated is presented in order to assess their applicability to the whole wake affected portion of the computational domain and outside the training region. It is shown how the best-performing closure can provide results in very good agreement with the experimental data in terms of wake loss profiles, with substantial improvements relative to traditional turbulence models. The discussed analysis also provides guidelines for defining an automated zonal application of turbulence closures trained for wake-mixing predictions.},

Simultaneously, the second module focuses on combing the available building blocks to construct the final solution. Besides, an adaptive control strategy is introduced to automatically evaluate the effectiveness of the building blocks and adjust the search behaviour adaptively so as to improve search efficiency. The proposed Co-CGP is tested on eight problems with different complexities. Experimental results show that the Co-CGP can significantly improve the performance of CGP, in terms of both search efficiency and accuracy.},

This method solves the symbolic regression problem for multi-target contexts, allowing the construction of a model, without previous knowledge of any of its elements, that fits a set of cases. Our proposal directly handles the multi-target data, encoding the individuals with a chromosome of several genes, where each gene constructs a mathematical expression that is related to a target variable. The operators used into the evolutionary process enable the constant creation of new genetic material, and some of them may favour the detection of the existing dependencies between target variables. The experimental stage showed the benefits of the gene expression programming paradigm to solve the multi-target regression problem.},

The chromosomes function as a genome and are subjected to modification by means of mutation, transposition, root transposition, gene transposition, gene recombination, and one- and two-point recombination. The chromosomes encode expression trees which are the object of selection. The creation of these separate entities (genome and expression tree) with distinct functions allows the algorithm to perform with high efficiency that greatly surpasses existing adaptive techniques. The suite of problems chosen to illustrate the power and versatility of gene expression programming includes symbolic regression, sequence induction with and without constant creation, block stacking, cellular automata rules for the density-classification problem, and two problems of boolean concept learning: the 11-multiplexer and the GP rule problem.},

MEP individuals are strings of genes encoding complex computer programs. When MEP individuals encode expressions, their representation is similar to the way in which compilers translate $C$ or $Pascal$ expressions into machine code. A unique MEP feature is the ability to store multiple solutions of a problem in a single chromosome. Usually, the best solution is chosen for fitness assignment. When solving symbolic regression or classification problems (or any other problems for which the training set is known before the problem is solved) MEP has the same complexity as other techniques storing a single solution in a chromosome (such as GP, CGP, GEP or GE). Evaluation of the expressions encoded into an MEP individual can be performed by a single parsing of the chromosome. Offspring obtained by crossover and mutation is always syntactically correct MEP individuals (computer programs). Thus, no extra processing for repairing newly obtained individuals is needed.},

In this paper, we propose an evolutionary-based neural architecture search approach for efficient discovery of convolutional models in a dynamic search space, within only 24 GPU hours. With its efficient search environment and phenotype representation, Gene Expression Programming is adapted for network's cell generation. Despite having limited GPU resource time and broad search space, our proposal achieved similar state-of-the-art to manually-designed convolutional networks and also NAS-generated ones, even beating similar constrained evolutionary-based NAS works. The best cells in different runs achieved stable results, with a mean error of 2.82 % in CIFAR-10 dataset (which the best model achieved an error of 2.67 %) and 18.83 % for CIFAR-100 (best model with 18.16 %). For ImageNet in the mobile setting, our best model achieved top-l and top-5 errors of 29.51 % and 10.37 %, respectively. Although evolutionary-based NAS works were reported to require a considerable amount of GPU time for architecture search, our approach obtained promising results in little time, encouraging further experiments in evolutionary-based NAS, for search and network representation improvements.},

abstract = {For the simulation of complex, three-dimensional turbulent flows within the Reynolds- Averaged Navier-Stokes framework, Explicit-Algebraic-Stress-Models (EASM) constitute an appealing alternative to traditional one- or two-equation turbulence models based on a linear stress-strain relationship. Due to the simplicity and numerical efficiency, two-dimensional EASM formulations are preferred over their more complex three-dimensional counterpart. However, three-dimensional EASM formulations use additional, higher order coupling terms which may have the potential to improve the predicted results for cases with three-dimensional mean flow. The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of EASM closures for predicting complex three-dimensional flows and to investigate potential differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional EASM formulations. All models to be investigated are implemented into OpenFOAM and are tested on the flow around an idealized wing-body junction and the flow over an three-dimensional axisymmteric hill. In addition, results are compared to the widely used K$\omega$-SST turbulence model. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by the authors.},

abstract = {A novel approach to turbulence model development is applied to formulate a Hybrid RANS/LES methodology suitable on coarse meshes. The Reynolds-stress damping function in the Flow Simulation Methodology (FSM) framework is difficult to formulate rigorously from first principles, however it is critical to the success of the model. The damping function dictates locally and instantaneously the contribution level of a RANS model required to supplement structures resolved by the grid. The current formulation is a damping of the turbulent length scale in a nonlinear explicit algebraic stress RANS closure. This turns the eddy viscosity into a sub-grid scale model. In this proposal Symbolic Regression, an evolutionary process according to survival of the fittest, is used to build a new damping function. A population of randomly generated damping functions is evolved by measuring how closely they represent an idealized form. This ideal dataset is generated by filtering DNS to represent a pseudo FSM flow field. In the present study DNS of a turbulent pipe flow is used. Hybrid RANS/LES using the new damping function is performed on two different test cases. Results are presented on coarse meshes for two dimensional periodic hills and inline tandem cylinders, for which the modified FSM performs very well.},

abstract = {We put forth a modular approach for distilling hidden flow physics from discrete and sparse observations. To address functional expressiblity, a key limitation of the black-box machine learning methods, we have exploited the use of symbolic regression as a principle for identifying relations and operators that are related to the underlying processes. This approach combines evolutionary computation with feature engineering to provide a tool for discovering hidden parameterizations embedded in the trajectory of fluid flows in the Eulerian frame of reference. Our approach in this study mainly involves gene expression programming (GEP) and sequential threshold ridge regression (STRidge) algorithms. We demonstrate our results in three different applications: (i) equation discovery, (ii) truncation error analysis, and (iii) hidden physics discovery, for which we include both predicting unknown source terms from a set of sparse observations and discovering subgrid scale closure models. We illustrate that both GEP and STRidge algorithms are able to distill the Smagorinsky model from an array of tailored features in solving the Kraichnan turbulence problem. Our results demonstrate the huge potential of these techniques in complex physics problems, and reveal the importance of feature selection and feature engineering in model discovery approaches.},

abstract = {Annually, the thermal coal industries produce billion tons of fly-ash (FA) as a waste by-product. Which has been proficiently used for the manufacture of FA based geopolymer concrete (FGC). To accelerate the usage of FA in building industry, an innovative machine learning techniques namely gene expression programming (GEP) and multi expression programming (MEP) are employed for forecasting the compressive strength of FGC. The comprehensive database is constructed comprising of 311 compressive strength results. The obtained equations relate the compressive strength of FGC with eight most effective parameters i.e., curing regime (T), time for curing (t) in hours, age of samples (A) in days, percentage of total aggregate by volume (% Ag), molarity of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (M), silica (SiO2) solids percentage in sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) solution (%S), superplasticizer (%P) and extra water (%EW) as percent FA. The accurateness and predictive capacity of both GEP and MEP model is assessed via statistical checks, external validation criteria suggested by different researcher and then compared with linear regression (LR) and non-linear regression (NLR) models. In comparison with MEP equation, the GEP equation has lesser statistical error and higher correlation coefficient. Also, the GEP equation is short and it would be easy to use in the field. So, the GEP model is further utilized for sensitivity and parametric study. This research will increase the re-usage of hazardous FA in the development of green concrete that would leads to environmental safety and monetarist reliefs.},

@article{Reissmann2021,
abstract = {Gene Expression Programming (GEP), a branch of machine learning, is based on the idea to iteratively improve a population of candidate solutions using an evolutionary process built on the survival-of-the-fittest concept. The GEP approach was initially applied with encouraging results to the modeling of the unclosed tensors in the context of RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) turbulence modeling. In a subsequent study it was demonstrated that the GEP concept can also be successfully used for modeling the unknown Sub-Grid Stress (SGS) tensor in the context of Large Eddy Simulations (LES). This was done in an a-priori analysis, where an existing Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) database was explicitly filtered to evaluate the unknown stresses and to assess the performance of model candidates suggested by GEP. This paper presents the next logical step, i.e. the application of GEP to a-posteriori LES model development. Because a-posteriori analysis, using in-the-loop optimization, is considered the ultimate way to test SGS models, this can be considered an important milestone for the application of machine learning to LES based turbulence modeling. GEP is here used to train LES models for simulating a Taylor Green Vortex (TGV) and results are compared with existing standard models. It is shown that GEP finds a model that outperforms known models from literature as well as the no-model LES. Although the performance of this best model is maintained for resolutions and Reynolds numbers different from the training data, this is not automatically guaranteed for all other models suggested by the algorithm.},

@article{Schoepplein2018,
abstract = {Recently the concept of Gene Expression Programming (GEP) has been introduced with very encouraging results for the purpose of modelling the unclosed tensors in the context of RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) turbulence modelling. This paper extends the previous framework to modelling subgrid stresses (SGS) in the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). In order to achieve this goal the GEP algorithm was coupled with an external multiprocessor postprocessing tool that evaluates a cost function based on a-priori analysis of explicitly filtered DNS data of turbulent premixed planar flames. Although LES of combustion systems is becoming increasingly popular, the closures for sub-grid scale (SGS) stresses have mostly been derived assuming constant density flows. However, it has been shown recently that depending on the relative strength of heat release and turbulence, counter-gradient transport can occur for the stress tensor if the isotropic part is not properly accounted for. The focus of this work is not to put forward a particular new model but to demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can successfully be used in the framework of LES modelling. To achieve this purpose the GEP software is used for modelling the deviatoric stress, the trace of the SGS tensor and the stress tensor itself. Although the functional form of the model was not imposed, the evolutionary algorithm did find a well known model from the literature with even the model constants comparable to values reported in the literature.},

@article{Weatheritt2016a,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel and promising approach to turbulence model formulation, rather than putting forward a particular new model. Evolutionary computation has brought symbolic regression of scalar fields into the domain of algorithms and this paper describes a novel expansion of Gene Expression Programming for the purpose of tensor modeling. By utilizing high-fidelity data and uncertainty measures, mathematical models for tensors are created. The philosophy behind the framework is to give freedom to the algorithm to produce a constraint-free model; its own functional form that was not previously imposed. Turbulence modeling is the target application, specifically the improvement of separated flow prediction. Models are created by considering the anisotropy of the turbulent stress tensor and formulating non-linear constitutive stress–strain relationships. A previously unseen flow field is computed and compared to the baseline linear model and an established non-linear model of comparable complexity. The results are highly encouraging.},

@article{Weatheritt2017c,
abstract = {This work presents developments to a novel evolutionary framework that symbolically regresses algebraic forms of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor. This work contributes to the growing trend in machine-learning for modelling physical phenomena. Our framework is shown to be computational inexpensive and produce accurate and robust models that are tangible mathematical expressions. This transparency in the result allows us to diagnose issues with the regressed formulae and appropriately make amendments, as we further understand the regression tools. Such models are created using hybrid RANS/LES flow field data and a passive solving of the RANS transport equations to obtain the modelled time scale. This process shows that models can be regressed from a qualitatively correct flow field and fully resolved DNS is not necessarily required. Models are trained and tested using rectangular ducts, an example flow genus that linear RANS models even qualitatively fail to predict correctly. A priori and a posteriori testing of the new models show that the framework is a viable methodology for RANS closure development. This a posteriori agenda includes testing on an asymmetric diffuser, for which the new models vastly outperform the baseline linear model. Therefore this study presents one of the most rigorous and complete CFD validation of machine learnt turbulent stress models to date.},

@article{Dominique2021,
abstract = {This paper presents a new data-driven approach for the establishment of empirical models describing turbulent boundary layer wall-pressure spectra. Unlike other models presented in literature, the new models are not derived by extending previously existing ones, but are directly built from a given dataset through symbolic regression using a machine learning algorithm known as Gene Expression Programming. Two modifications of the GEP algorithm presented in literature are proposed in this work to cope with some issues that are specific to the modelling of wall pressure spectra: a new power terminal and a local optimization loop. The validity of the new approach is first demonstrated using as input a dataset synthesized following the Chase-Howe and Goody models. The method is then applied to experimental data for a flat plate boundary layer. The results indicate that the wall pressure model obtained with the proposed approach remains consistent with previous formulations for zero pressure gradient, while showing a better match with the data and suggesting new ways to predict the influence of moderate pressure gradient},
